A quick put together of a personal website.

The intention here is to display some of the frontend aspect of my 
full stack engineering skills without breaching any NDAs. 

This will showcase:
- Some red-green-refactor method TDD (not everything will be built as such, just to showcase)
- Typescript
- React
- ThreeJS
- HTML, JS, CSS
- CI/CD pipeline with safe git flow
- AWS Cloud services (because it's free)
- NodeJS (naturally)
- Tailwindcss
