A quick put together of a personal website.

The intention here is to display some of the frontend aspect of my 
full stack engineering skills without breaching any NDAs. 

Note allowJs=true in tsconfig, this is to make it easier to import 3d gbl objects (easier in JS, see gblExport.jsx)

This will showcase:
- Some red-green-refactor method TDD (not everything will be built as such, just demonstrating that I understand how to test and different testing methodologies)
- Typescript
- React
- ThreeJS (fiber, drei)
- HTML, JS, CSS
- CI/CD pipeline with safe git flow (this is an automatic CI/CD pipeline obvs, I'll have to do a backend project with something more curated)
- AWS Cloud services EDIT: I'm moving from amplify as it was incurring costs even though listed as free.
- NodeJS (naturally)
- Tailwindcss
